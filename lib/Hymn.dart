    "JEHOVAH, THE UNCREA-TED-\nCre-a-tor of good things.\nFrom age to age, Thou art the same-\nO Thou “ANCIENT OF DAYS”\nThou made man out of the dust,\nAnd gave him breath of life;\nThou made the earth for him, LORD\nTo dwell for evermore.",

    "LORD, as Thou art so are we,\nIn Thy form and likeness;\nBut Thou art no blood, flesh or bones,\nAnd other differences;\nThou cove’rest  Thyself with light,\nAnd walked upon the wind:\nWhen Thou alone existed,\nNo heav’n nor earth was made.",
    "All o’er Thy glorious body,\nShines brighter than the sun;\nThou sittest on Thy heav’nly throne,\nWith bright colours around,\nAs amber and sa’phire stone,\nThy heav’nly throne doth shine:\nMore glorious than a-ny throne,\nThat mortal man can make.",
    "When Thou thought of cre-a-ting,\nThou crea-ted “Logos” first\nBegotten One as Thy delight;\nBy whom good things were made.\nCame to earth as Christ Jesus,\nTo bring us back to Thee;\nAs in Adam all would die,\nE’en in Christ all shall live.",

    "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY! All the saints adore Thee,\nCasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\nCherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,\nWhich wast, and art, and evermore shall be.",
    "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY! Though the darkness hide Thee,\nThough the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,\nOnly Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee\nPerfect in pow’r, in love and purity.",
